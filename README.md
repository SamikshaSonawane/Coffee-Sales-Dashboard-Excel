# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## Aim
The coffee shop aims to gain comprehensive insights into its sales data to identify key factors influencing coffee sales. Understanding these factors will enable the shop to make informed decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational improvements to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
- Determine the average order value for loyalty card members versus non-members.
- Identify products most frequently purchased by loyalty card members.
- Analyze demographic characteristics of the most loyal customers.
- Calculate total sales figures for each product.
- Identify products with the highest and lowest sales volumes.

## Insights
1. Excelsa and Libreca show the highest peaks, indicating susceptibility to seasonality or promotions.
  - Arabica exhibits a more stable and predictable sales pattern despite showing peaks.
  - Robusta, though generally lower in sales, has steady peaks suggesting a consistent, albeit smaller, market.

2. The difference between the highest (Arabica) and lowest (Libreca) quantities sold is 88 units.
  - All four varieties have a close range of total quantities sold (811 to 899), indicating a relatively balanced market distribution among these coffee types.
  - Arabica has the highest total quantity sold at 899 units.

3. Non-loyalty card owners have an average sale of 47 units.
  - Loyalty card owners have an average sale of 44 units.
  - There is a 3-unit difference, indicating that the loyalty card program might not be as effective in driving higher individual purchase volumes.

4. The United States boasts the highest sales with 34,513 units. 
 - The United Kingdom has the lowest sales at 2,621 units.
